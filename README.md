# Simple-Calculator
This Python program implements a basic calculator using the tkinter module. The program prompts the user to input two numbers and then performs arithmetic operations upon preference. Exception handling is implemented to handle errors that may occur during runtime. Additionally, the program allows the user to choose whether they want to try again.
